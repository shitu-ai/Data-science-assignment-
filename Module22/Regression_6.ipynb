        "2. **Cloud Hosting**:\n",
        "   - Utilizes interconnected virtual servers across multiple locations.\n",
        "   - **Public Clouds** (e.g., Google Cloud Platform): Virtually unlimited resources.\n",
        "   - **Private Clouds**: Customizable and secure.\n",
        "   - **Hybrid Clouds**: Combine benefits of public and private clouds.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Start by designing for mobile devices first, then scale up to desktop. This ensures a focus on essential features and efficient use of screen real estate¬π.\n",
        "   - Ask: Is this feature necessary? How can we create a minimalist design that scales well to larger screens?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Flexible Everything**:\n",
        "   - Use flexible layouts, images, and typography. Design elements should adapt to different screen sizes¬≥.\n",
        "   - Prioritize fluid and adaptive layouts by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Breakpoints**:\n",
        "   - Define breakpoints where the layout adjusts based on screen width (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).\n",
        "   - Test thoroughly at each breakpoint to ensure a smooth transition.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Design for Thumbs**:\n",
        "   - Consider touch gestures and thumb reach on mobile devices.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Mobile Device Features**:\n",
        "   - Leverage native hardware features (e.g., GPS, camera, accelerometer) to enhance the user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Typography Matters**:\n",
        "   - Use responsive typography that adjusts based on screen size.\n",
        "   - Ensure readability across devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Prioritize and Hide Content**:\n",
