It allows us to make better guesses about the world by incorporating prior knowledge and adjusting it based on observed data. Here are some practical applications:\n",

        "1. **Spam Filtering**: Email systems use Bayes' Theorem to distinguish between legitimate emails and spam. By analyzing word frequencies in both spam and non-spam messages, filters assign probabilities to incoming emails being spam. For instance, if an email contains words commonly found in spam (like \"free\" or \"discount\"), the filter calculates the likelihood that it's spam⁴.\n",

By combining data from various sources (satellite imagery, weather stations, historical patterns), forecast models calculate the probability of different weather outcomes. For example, if a high-pressure system is moving in from the west, Bayes' Theorem helps assess the likelihood of clear skies versus rain in a specific region⁴.\n",
