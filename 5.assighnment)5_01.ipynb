    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: \n",
    "    Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. \n",
    "    It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: \n",
    "    Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the object. \n",
    "    It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, enabling code reusability and simplifying complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance:\n",
    "    Inheritance is a mechanism by which a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behavior (attributes and methods) from another class (superclass or base class). \n",
    "    It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship among classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: \n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "    It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows methods to behave differently based on the object they are operating on.\n",
    "    Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding."
