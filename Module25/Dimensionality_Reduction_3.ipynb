        "\n",
        "The **Spectral Theorem** is a fundamental result in linear algebra that provides conditions under which a matrix can be diagonalized via eigen-decomposition. It applies specifically to **normal matrices** (including symmetric, Hermitian, and orthogonal/unitary matrices) and has significant implications in various areas such as quantum mechanics, data science, and numerical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Statement of the Spectral Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Spectral Theorem** states that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **For Real Symmetric Matrices**: Every real symmetric matrix \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\) can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. That is, there exists an orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) (where \\(Q^T = Q^{-1}\\)) and a diagonal matrix \\(\\Lambda\\) such that:\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",

        "1. **Diagonalizability**: The theorem guarantees that any real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized. Diagonalization simplifies many operations, such as computing matrix powers, solving systems of linear equations, and analyzing matrix functions. For these matrices, all eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Orthogonality and Unitarity**: The eigenvectors of real symmetric and complex Hermitian matrices are not just linearly independent but are also orthogonal (in the real case) or unitary (in the complex case). This property is crucial in numerical analysis, quantum mechanics, and signal processing, where maintaining orthogonality or unitarity is important for preserving numerical stability and physical meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Simplicity of Representation**: Diagonal matrices are much simpler to work with than general matrices. Many matrix operations (such as exponentiation and inversion) become trivial when the matrix is diagonal. The spectral theorem allows us to transform a complex matrix into a simple diagonal form, thereby simplifying complex operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Applications in Quantum Mechanics and Data Science**: The Spectral Theorem is fundamental in quantum mechanics, where Hermitian operators represent observable quantities with real eigenvalues corresponding to measurable quantities. In data science, the spectral theorem underpins methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which relies on the diagonalization of the covariance matrix.\n",
