    "Use Case: When you want to create a base class that defines a set of methods (abstract methods) that must be overridden by its subclasses.\n",
    "How abc Works:\n",
    "The abc module works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. You achieve this by using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",

    "Key Components of the abc Module:\n",
    "ABCMeta Metaclass:\n",
    "The ABCMeta metaclass is provided by the abstract base class. Every abstract class must use ABCMeta as its metaclass.\n",
    "It allows you to create an ABC. An ABC can be subclassed directly and acts as a mix-in class.\n",
    "You can also register unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated ABCs as “virtual subclasses.” These and their descendants will be considered subclasses of the registering ABC by the built-in issubclass() function.\n",
