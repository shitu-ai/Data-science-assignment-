    "Minimalistic: Flask provides only the essentials for building web applications, making it easy to set up and use.\n",
    "Routing: Flask allows you to define routes (URL endpoints) and associate them with specific functions. This makes it straightforward to handle different pages or API endpoints in your scraping project.\n",
    "Templates: Flask supports template rendering, allowing you to create dynamic HTML pages. You can use templates to display scraped data in a user-friendly format.\n",
    "HTTP Requests: Web scraping involves making HTTP requests to retrieve data from websites. Flask provides tools for handling incoming requests (e.g., GET or POST) and responding with scraped data.\n",
    "Integration with Libraries: Flask can be easily integrated with popular Python libraries like Beautiful Soup (for parsing HTML) and Requests (for making HTTP requests).\n",
    "Customization: Flask allows you to customize your scraping logic and handle data processing as needed.\n",
    "Remember that Flask is just one of many options for building web scraping projects. Depending on your specific requirements, you might choose other frameworks or tools. However, Flaskâ€™s simplicity and versatility make it a popular choice for small to medium-sized scraping tasks."
