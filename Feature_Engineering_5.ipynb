        "1. **Label Encoding**:\n",
        "   - Label Encoding is simply converting each category in a categorical variable into a numerical value. Each category is assigned a unique integer.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     - Categorical variable: [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n",
        "     - Label Encoding: {\"red\": 0, \"green\": 1, \"blue\": 2}\n",
        "   - Use cases:\n",
        "     - When the categorical variable is ordinal, meaning it has a clear ordering (e.g., \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\").\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
        "   - Ordinal Encoding involves assigning a numerical value to each category, but in a way that preserves the order or rank among the categories.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     - Categorical variable: [\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"]\n",
        "     - Ordinal Encoding: {\"low\": 1, \"medium\": 2, \"high\": 3}\n",
        "   - Use cases:\n",
        "     - When the categorical variable is ordinal and the categories have a meaningful order that should be preserved in the encoding (e.g., levels of education: \"high school\", \"college\", \"graduate\").\n",
        "\n",
        "**Choosing between them:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use **Label Encoding** when:\n",

        "  - Preserving the order is important for the model (e.g., in decision trees where the split points depend on numerical values).\n",

        "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. It assigns numerical labels to categories in such a way that the labels are ordered according to the target variable's mean or median value for each category. Here's how it typically works:\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable `education_level` and a target variable `income` (numeric, representing income levels). The `education_level` categories are \"high school\", \"college\", and \"graduate\". Here's how you might apply Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calculate the mean `income` for each category:\n",
        "  - Mean income for \"high school\": $40,000\n",

        "\n",
        "- Order the categories based on their mean income in ascending order:\n",
        "  - \"high school\" < \"college\" < \"graduate\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- Assign ordinal labels:\n",
        "  - \"high school\" -> 1\n",
        "  - \"college\" -> 2\n",
        "  - \"graduate\" -> 3\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, \"high school\" gets the lowest label because it has the lowest mean income, while \"graduate\" gets the highest label due to the highest mean income.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ordinal Variables with Target Relationship**: Use it when the categorical variable has an ordinal nature and there is a clear relationship between the categories and the target variable. For instance, in the example above, education level is typically correlated with income level.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decision Tree Algorithms**: It can be particularly useful in decision tree-based algorithms (like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines) where the order of categories can influence the split points, improving the model's predictive performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Avoiding Curse of Dimensionality**: It helps in reducing the dimensionality of categorical variables by converting them into ordinal variables, which can simplify the model without losing important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is beneficial when you want to leverage the relationship between a categorical variable and the target variable by encoding it in a way that preserves this relationship effectively for predictive modeling."

        "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together. In essence, it indicates the degree to which two variables tend to deviate from their respective means in a similar way. Here’s a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definition**: Covariance between two variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) is denoted as \\( \\text{Cov}(X, Y) \\). It’s calculated as the expected value (or average value in the long run) of the product of the deviations of \\( X \\) from its mean \\( \\mu_X \\) and \\( Y \\) from its mean \\( \\mu_Y \\):\n",

        "   - A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Importance in Statistical Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Relationship Assessment**: Covariance helps in understanding the direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that higher values of one variable tend to correspond with higher values of the other, and vice versa for negative covariance.\n",
        "   - **Scale Dependent**: The magnitude of covariance depends on the scales of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\). This makes interpretation difficult without normalization or standardization.\n",
        "   - **Basis for Other Measures**: Covariance is foundational for calculating correlation coefficients, which standardize the relationship between variables to facilitate easier interpretation and comparison.\n",

        "   \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "   Where:\n",
        "   - \\( X_i \\) and \\( Y_i \\) are individual data points,\n",
        "   - \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are the sample means of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\),\n",
        "   - \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n",

        "   - For example:\n",
        "     - Male → 0\n",
        "     - Female → 1\n",
        "\n",

        "   - \"Education Level\" has multiple unordered categories (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).\n",
        "   - One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, indicating presence (1) or absence (0).\n",
        "   - For example:\n",
        "     - High School → [1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
        "     - Bachelor's → [0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
        "     - Master's → [0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
        "     - PhD → [0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Employment Status (Ordinal Encoding or Custom Mapping):**\n",
        "   - \"Employment Status\" has an inherent order (Unemployed < Part-Time < Full-Time).\n",
        "   - Ordinal encoding assigns integer labels based on the order (e.g., 0, 1, 2).\n",
        "   - Alternatively, you can create a custom mapping (e.g., Unemployed → 0, Part-Time → 1, Full-Time → 2).\n",
