        "The choice between using the Filter method and the Wrapper method for feature selection largely depends on the specific characteristics and constraints of the problem you're addressing. Here are some situations where you might prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Large Datasets**:\n",
        "   - **Filter Method**: When dealing with very large datasets, the Filter method is generally more efficient because it does not involve training a model multiple times. It uses statistical techniques to evaluate the relevance of features, making it faster and more scalable.\n",
        "   - **Wrapper Method**: The Wrapper method, on the other hand, involves training and evaluating models for different subsets of features, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **High Dimensionality**:\n",
        "   - **Filter Method**: When the number of features is very high, the Filter method can quickly eliminate irrelevant or redundant features based on statistical measures without having to train a model. This makes it suitable for high-dimensional data.\n",
        "   - **Wrapper Method**: The computational cost of the Wrapper method increases exponentially with the number of features, making it impractical for datasets with very high dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Speed and Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **Filter Method**: If the primary concern is speed and computational efficiency, the Filter method is preferred as it is generally faster and less resource-intensive. This is important in real-time applications or when quick iterations are needed.\n",
        "   - **Wrapper Method**: While the Wrapper method can provide more accurate feature selection, it is slower due to the need to repeatedly train and evaluate the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Independence from Model Choice**:\n",
        "   - **Filter Method**: The Filter method is model-agnostic, meaning it does not depend on the choice of the learning algorithm. It selects features based on their intrinsic properties and their relationships with the target variable.\n",
        "   - **Wrapper Method**: The Wrapper method is model-dependent, as it selects features based on their performance with a specific learning algorithm. This makes the selection process specific to the chosen model.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Preliminary Feature Selection**:\n",
        "   - **Filter Method**: It can be used as a preliminary step to quickly reduce the number of features before applying more computationally intensive methods, such as the Wrapper method.\n",
        "   - **Wrapper Method**: It is typically used after a preliminary reduction in the number of features or when computational resources are not a constraint.\n",

        "In summary, the Filter method is preferred in situations where you need a fast, efficient, and model-agnostic approach to feature selection, especially when dealing with large datasets, high dimensionality, or when performing a preliminary feature reduction. The Wrapper method, while potentially more accurate, is better suited for smaller datasets and situations where computational resources and time are not primary constraints."

        "### Step 3: Apply Statistical Techniques for Feature Selection\n",
        "- **Correlation Analysis (for Numerical Features)**:\n",

        "  - Select features that have a significant correlation with the target variable. Features with low or no correlation can be discarded.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Chi-Squared Test (for Categorical Features)**:\n",
        "  - Use the Chi-Squared test to determine the association between categorical features and the target variable.\n",

        "  - Perform ANOVA F-tests to compare the means of numerical features across different classes of the target variable.\n",
